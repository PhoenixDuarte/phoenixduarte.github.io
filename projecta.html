 The app starts off with a branding screen that Pierce created logo and all. It moves onto the main title screen, which has one feature other than the music—bringing you to the game itself by pressing the start button. Once in the game, all you need to do is tap on the face in the middle of the screen after clicking on one of the buttons on the notifier. Once you tap the face enough, the level will switch. Each tap adds a single point to your score. At the end, once you defeat the third ‘boss, you get the ending screen and the about screen. The about screen displays our names, Pierce Gregor and Phoenix Duarte-Commandeur, and a back button to go back to the ending screen along with a restart button in case you want to play again.

  I had a few difficulties while programming our game. One includes the notifier boxes. Pierce and I couldnt figure out where they would fit, and we spent around fifteen minutes arguing where they should go (He wanted one at the beginning and end, I wanted one in the beginning of the first level), and we eventually compromised at the beginning of each level, detailing a backstory of the game, which we developed together overtime.
<br>
<br>
  Another difficulty was the art. I made all the sprites and picked out the background. Pierce wanted the art to be something different, and so did I, but we reached another compromise with our new clicker game. It worked out well, as it brought several more ideas to the table, which I may possibly expand on in the future. My second difficulty was figuring out how to implement a procedure, which I did independently. I figured out that to implement a procedure I simply needed to call a block of code, which didnt really have to repeat. That took me a little bit to figure out. It worked properly after that.
<br>
<br>
  By far the biggest difficulty I encountered was implementing the music. At first, I used the sound block in the designer, but when I finally managed to insert the music, it would cut out immediately and then restart on the next screen, leading to a buildup of several songs. I remedied this by replacing the sound block with the player block, which stopped the song from cutting out and fixed the song restarting on the next level/screen.
<br>
<br>
  We started off by laying the entire app out, starting with level one, two, three, the end, and then the intro. We had some trouble with the branding screen but we fixed that quickly and moved the intro screen from screen1 to the intro screen. Afterwards, I worked on the basic functions with the button, which Pierce helped with. After that, we got the screens to switch to another after reaching a certain score (Ex. 100 required to go to next level/screen) and added a score counter. We then added music and fixed the problem with the sound blocks mentioned earlier. We then added an about screen and spruced up the intro, added a restart button in the about screen, and then we considered it finished… for now.
