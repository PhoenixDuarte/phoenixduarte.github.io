Our game is about a man trapped in a space station, and he's attempting to get out. You have to use your wits (and luck) to escape the space station! You type in the first letter of the words in uppercase (E.g. S = Swim), and advance the story through your choices. We made several paths, but most of them lead to deaths due to the fact the station is disabled. This was entirely on purpose. We wanted to give those that play it a sense of danger, and I wanted to give it a more eighties 'die-from-everything' arcadey vibe. I think I succeeded in both accounts. You have to replay the game to learn from your mistakes, also intentional. The end of the game either leads in your death, or you successfully escaping the space station.

This project was difficult, as I had little knowledge in programming in Python. We (Jesse and I) went through several hardships throughout the process of creating it. For one, the indentations were quite tricky to use. My partner and I occasionally used spaces instead of the tab, so when we were finished the portion that we worked on, it was generally riddled with bugs. We corrected this by re-checking our code through the system. Our second major problem was the fact that we could not figure out how to do an entire portion of our code. We had a couple experiences like this. For example, we couldn't figure out how to make the player character be able to pick up items, such as the critical welder at the end of the game. We made an entirely seperate path for those who pick it up, and those who do not. They look identical until the end, where it'll tell you if you lose or win. Another example is the 'choose three out of five logs' section. We eventually decided that we didn't have enough time for that, at least with the time provided, so we moved past it and simply allowed them to choose one of five.
<br>
A more personal problem involved python, which I didn't fully understand until the second time or so when I programmed. I learned how to program more efficiently over time, and figured out little quirks in the code to make it easier on me and my partner, such as using tabs instead of spaces when programming in python. On my own, I finished the hub area. I made the user go from the main doors to the hub, and I added the several branches that lead to the new areas, including the Biodome, Residential District, and Command Bridge, among others. This leads to a wider variety of choices for the player, and a desire to figure out where all destinations lead.
