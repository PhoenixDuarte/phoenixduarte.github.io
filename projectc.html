<br>
Our project was written in python and is a multi-question quiz. In addition, the quiz randomizes the questions. There is a bank full of a multitude of questions, and it randomly selects from that list. If you get a question wrong, the game ends and prints the amount of money you get, which increments by 250 dollars each. If you win, another random question is selected. One thing not shown in the video is the two bonus modes: the hard and easy mode, which have hard and easy questions respectively.

My partner and I had little difficulty programming a majority of the project. There were a couple points where we couldn't figure out what to do, such as removing an already asked question from our list of questions, which we remedied by referencing code online. Jesse managed to check a couple forums and python guides and figure out exactly what was wrong with our half-baked code. We thought that we had fixed it, but, upon running the program, it did not work. This led to a couple encounters with the teacher, and after a full class period, we managed to figure it out. Another major problem was actually managing to get our While loop working. The while loop in our program scans through the entire question bank and selects a question. Once it is guessed correctly, it loops again. At first, it failed to loop. We fixed this by moving our programming around and trying to isolate the problem, which we did. Afterwards, it was quickly patched by Jesse and I by once again moving our code and changing a few small details, like returns becoming prints.
<br>
<br>
Independently, I worked on the randomization of the questions. This was quite a simple task, as all I had to do was reference prior code from assignments given in the past, and import a couple functions from future python, such as 'random'. I also considered importing 'print' from the future to make the text look better, but I decided against it. When we started this project, I was quite inexperienced with using 'if', 'while', 'or' and 'else/elif' functions, but this project really aided me in figuring out how to properly use them.
