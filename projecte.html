The video shows my program running. The 'Text' menu option shows several options, which allow the user to change the text, such as bolding it, italicising it, and making it plain again. The next tab allows the user to change the font size to big or small. Next, the final tab allows the user to copy the text into a dialog box. The rest of the program allows the user to type into the box.

Me and my partner had a lot of different problems during the entirety of our project. Neither of us were proficient in Java, so we had to learn as we went along, trying to figure out exactly how things tick in Swing. That was our first major problem while working on the program. In terms of actual problems with the code, we had difficulty trying to figure out how to resize the font. We remedied this by looking over the code and verifying that we had our code correctly inputted, over an extrordinarily long amount of time. A mysterious benefactor also helped us. Our code had a single number missing, therefore messing it all up. We fixed it, and the text finally managed to resize properly. My individual second problem was managing to get the GUI to properly function at the correct size and for everything to line up properly. I remedied this through trial and error, and with a little bit of help from the internet, though only for brief references. Eventually, the program worked properly.
